# State Plate

This project is meant to be used as a template for React apps with TypeScript using a hook to manage global state. Note that because there's only one reducer, it will be hard to manage state if your state gets too complex. See all the branches for other React boilerplates.

## Getting Started with State Plate

To use this template for your own project, you should update the following:

1. Update `state.ts` and `reducer.ts` to meet the needs of your state. 
2. Change the `<title>` tag in `index.html` to the desired title.
3. Change the description `<meta>` tag in `index.html` to the desired description.
4. Change the `name` key in both `package.json` & `package-lock.json` to the desired project name.
5. Change the `short_name` and `name` keys in `manifest.json` to the desired name.
6. [Optional] Update the `tsconfig.json` & `.eslintrc.json` to your needs.

You're good to go, enjoy!
